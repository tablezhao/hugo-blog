**Presidential Proclamation -- National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, 2016**

**总统讲话 —— 2016年全国家庭暴力宣传月**

The physical and emotional scars of domestic violence can cast a long shadow. Too many individuals, regardless of age, ability, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, circumstance, or race, face the pain and fear of domestic violence. During National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, we shine a light on this violation of the basic human right to be free from violence and abuse, pledge to ensure every victim of domestic violence knows they are not alone, and foster supportive communities that help survivors seek justice and enjoy full and healthy lives.

由家庭暴力造成的身体和情感上的伤痕会造成长期的阴影。有太多的个体，无论年龄、智力、性别、性取向、性别认知、经济状况或者种族，都面对着家庭暴力的痛苦和恐惧。在今年的全国家庭暴力宣传月，我们为家暴这种对不受暴力和虐待基本人权的侵犯行为带来一线亮光，我们承诺确保使每一个家庭暴力的受害者知道他们并不孤单，促进社会救助团体去帮助家暴受害者寻求正义和享受完整、健康的生活。

Over the past two decades, rates of domestic violence against females have dropped by nearly three-quarters -- but there is still much work to do to build on the progress we have made. Nearly 1 in 4 women and 1 in 7 men have suffered from domestic violence by an intimate partner. All people deserve to feel safe with loved ones, and my Administration is committed to eliminating this scourge and supporting survivors' healing -- and we must ensure that survivors and their families have access to the resources, care, and support they need to do so.

在过去的20年里，对女性的家庭暴力比率已经下降了接近四分之三，但在已经取得的进展基础之上，我们仍有许多工作要做。几乎每四名女性、七名男性中就有一人曾遭受过来自亲密恋人的家庭暴力。所有人与其所爱之人在一起时应该感到安全，因此我的政府承诺消除家暴之苦并支持家暴受害者从伤痛中恢复，我们必须确保受害者及他们的家人能够获得资源、关心，他们恢复所需的支持。

My Administration is dedicated to ensuring that all people feel safe in all aspects of their lives, which is why I proposed significant funding for responding to domestic violence in my most recent budget proposal. We have also championed legislative action like the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act, and the Affordable Care Act -- which ensures that most health plans cover domestic violence screening and counseling services at no additional cost. And the Violence Against Women Act, which was reauthorized in 2013, has enhanced and expanded protections to Native Americans, immigrants, lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals, and victims who reside in public housing.

我的政府致力于确保所有人在他们生活中每一方面都感觉安全，这是为什么在我最近的财政预算中提出为家庭暴力提供重要的资金。我们也支持如《Family Violence Prevention》、《Services Act》、《Affordable Care Act》这样的立法活动，这些法律确保了大多数医疗保险覆盖了家庭暴力伤害的检查和咨询服务且没有额外的费用。此外《Violence Against Women Act》于2013年得到批准，加强和扩大了对美洲原住民、移民、女同性恋、男同性恋、双性恋以及变性人和居住在公共房屋中的家暴受害人的保护。

This is progress we must continue to invest in and carry forward. Earlier this year, I announced a series of commonsense steps my Administration is taking to reduce gun violence, including work to renew our domestic violence outreach efforts. Building on the work of our Police Data Initiative, the White House is promoting smart approaches to collecting data on domestic violence offenses that balance transparency and accountability with victim safety and privacy. And victim safety should also be a priority in the workplace -- a truth that extends to the Federal Government. That is why I directed all Federal agencies to adopt domestic violence workplace policies and encouraged employers to do the same.

这是我们必须继续投资和弘扬的事业。在今年早些时候，我宣布了一系列政府正在采取的减少枪支暴力的常识性步骤，包括创新通过非家庭内部解决家暴问题的工作。建立在“警方数据倡议”的工作上，白宫正在尝试采用智能方法收集关于家庭暴力犯罪的数据，以平衡透明度和问责制与受害者安全和隐私。受害人的安全也应该是工作场所的优先考虑的事项－包括在联邦政府工作范围内。这是为什么我指示所有联邦机构采用家庭暴力工作场所政策，并鼓励雇主们也这样做。

Our agencies have taken many critical actions to advance this cause. For example, the Department of Justice has invested millions of dollars in new initiatives to prevent domestic violence homicides, urge law enforcement agencies to identify and prevent gender bias when responding to domestic violence and sexual assault, and expand services to underserved victims. And the Department of Housing and Urban Development recently issued guidance to prevent housing discrimination against survivors of domestic violence.

我们的政府机构已经采取了许多重要行动来推进这一事业。 例如，司法部已投入数百万美元用于防止家庭暴力引发的杀人案件的新倡议，敦促执法机构在应对家庭暴力和性侵犯时确认和防止性别偏见，并扩大对尚未接受服务的受害者的服务。 住房和城市发展部最近发布了防止对家庭暴力受害者的住房歧视的指导。

Vice President Joe Biden's leadership has helped guide our progress and worked to change our national culture -- which too often tolerates and condones domestic violence. We are challenging harmful stereotypes associated with victims of domestic violence and striving to bring the practice of victim-blaming to an end. We must continue to recognize survivors who experience disproportionate rates of domestic violence, and who have been placed at the margins for generations, including women of color, Native Americans, individuals with disabilities, members of the LGBT community, immigrants, and older adults. Along these lines, we also joined with Canada and Mexico to create the North American Working Group on Violence against Indigenous Women and Girls, working together to enhance responses to violent crimes against indigenous women and girls in North America.

字副总统乔 拜登的领导下，帮助引导我们的进步，并努力改变我们“常常容忍和纵容家庭暴力”的国家文化 。 我们正在挑战与家庭暴力受害者有关的有害成见，并努力杜绝对受害者责难的做法。 我们必须继续认识到经历过不成比例的家庭暴力的受害者，他们曾被置于几代人的边缘，包括有色妇女，美洲原住民，残疾人，LGBT社区成员，移民和老年人。 在这方面，我们还与加拿大和墨西哥一道，成立了北美原住民妇女和女童暴力工作组，共同努力加强针对北美原住民妇女和女孩的暴力犯罪的打击。

Our Nation's character is tested whenever this injustice is tolerated. When anyone is targeted by someone they place their trust in, we have a responsibility to speak up. We all have a role to play in building a bright and safe future for each other and for future generations. This month, we recommit to standing with survivors of domestic violence and to doing our utmost to extend hope and healing to all who need it. If you or someone you know needs assistance, I encourage you to reach out to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, which recently engaged in its 4 millionth conversation with victims and survivors of domestic violence, by calling 1-800-799-SAFE, or visiting www.TheHotline.org.

当这样的不公正被容忍时，我们国家的性格将被检验。 当任何人被他们信任的人作为伤害对象时，我们有责任大声说出来。 我们都有责任为彼此和子孙后代建立一个光明和安全的未来。 这个月，我们再次承诺与家庭暴力的受害者站在一起，竭尽全力地向所有有需要的人伸出希望和医疗之手。 如果您或您认识的人需要帮助，我鼓励您联系全国家庭暴力热线，该热线最近与家庭暴力的受害者和幸存者进行了第400万次谈话，请致电1-800-799-SAFE，或访问 www.TheHotline.org 。

NOW, THEREFORE, I, BARACK OBAMA, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim October 2016 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. I call on all Americans to speak out against domestic violence and support local efforts to assist victims of these crimes in finding the help and healing they need.

因此，美利坚合众国总统巴拉克·奥巴马现在根据宪法和美国法律授予我的权力，宣布2016年10月为全国家庭暴力宣传月。 我呼吁所有美国人反对家庭暴力，支持地方政府的努力，帮助这些罪行的受害者寻求帮助和抚平他们所受的伤害。

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord two thousand sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and forty-first.

为示信守，我谨于公元2016年9月30日，美国独立第241年签署此声明。

BARACK OBAMA

巴拉克 奥巴马
